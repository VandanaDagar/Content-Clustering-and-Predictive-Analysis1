This repository contains the full implementation of a project focused on analyzing and forecasting trends within a content library, with a particular emphasis on movies and TV shows. The project employs a combination of data clustering techniques and predictive modeling to provide comprehensive insights into content segmentation and future trends.

Project Highlights:

-Data Preprocessing: Involves handling missing data, encoding categorical variables (genres and ratings), and normalizing data for analysis.
-Clustering Techniques: Utilizes K-Means clustering to segment content based on various attributes, aiding in understanding audience preferences and content distribution.
-Predictive Modeling: Implements ARIMA for time series forecasting to predict future content additions, enabling strategic planning.
-Visualization: Includes detailed visualizations such as bar plots, scatter plots, and trend lines to illustrate findings and patterns clearly.

Libraries Used:

-Pandas & NumPy: For data manipulation and numerical operations.
-Scikit-Learn: For machine learning algorithms, including clustering and preprocessing.
-Statsmodels: For statistical modeling and time series analysis.
-Seaborn & Matplotlib: For creating informative and visually appealing plots.
